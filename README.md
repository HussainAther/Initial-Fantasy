TODO: Still implementing battles, quests, and options for the player to complete their quest.

## Setup / Instructions
To run the RPG game on your computer, you'll need to set up a local development environment and serve the files using a web server. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Install Node.js: If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org). Node.js includes the npm package manager, which we'll use to set up the development environment.

2. Clone or downlaod the GitHub repository to your computer. 

3. Open a terminal or command prompt: Open a terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the project directory you created.

4. Initialize the project: In the terminal, run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:

```
npm init -y
```

5. Install a local web server: Install a local web server package like "http-server" using npm. Run the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install --save-dev http-server
```

6. Serve the files: Once the installation is complete, run the following command in the terminal to start the web server and serve the RPG game files:

```
npx http-server
```

7. Open the game in a browser: The web server will provide a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8080) where you can access the RPG game. Open your web browser and enter the provided URL.
